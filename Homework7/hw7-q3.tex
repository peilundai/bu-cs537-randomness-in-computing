\subsection*{(a)}

\proof 

In Phase 1 of the algorithm, assuming we are using bit-fixing algorithm. Let $P_i$ and $P_j$ be two paths that was separated at step $k$, which means that at their point of separation, they share bits from bit 1 to bit $k-1$, and different in bit $k$. Assuming first that they joined at a later step $l>k$, then based on the bit-fixing algorithm, the first $l$ bits should be the same, which contradicts the assumption that they different at bit $k < l$. Thus, they could not rejoin after they separates.

\subsection*{(b)}

Solutions: No. (a) doesn't imply that for any two packets $i$ and $j$, there is at most one node such that $i$ and $j$ are waiting in queue. 

Just consider the case that after the two bits joined at step $k$, and later at step $l$, they separate ways. If their targets share bits from $k$ to $l-1$ and that $l-k \geq 2$, then they could wait in queue at nodes from $k$ all the way to $l-1$, which is more than one node.
