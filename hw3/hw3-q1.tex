\section*{1. (Detecting defects) }

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection*{(a)} \proof 

Let $D$ to denote the event that at least one defective cookie is found. Then 

\begin{align}
	Pr[D] 	& = 1 - (1-p)^k \\
			& \geq 1 - (1-\alpha)^k \\
			& \geq 1 - (1-\alpha)^{\frac{\ln{100}}{\alpha}} \\
			& \geq 1 - (e^{-\alpha})^{\frac{\ln{100}}{\alpha}} \\
			& \geq 1 - e^{\ln{1/100}} \\
			& \geq 1 - 0.01 = 0.99
\end{align}

Note that from (1) to (2), we have used the inequality $p \geq \alpha$; from (2) to (3), we have used the inequality $k \geq {\ln{100} \over \alpha}$; and from (3) to (4), we have used the inequality $1-\alpha \leq e^{-\alpha}$.

\subsection*{(b)} Solution: Let $p_i$ be the proportion of detective cookies the $i^{th}$ worker baked; Let $D_i$ be the event that if $p_i \geq \alpha$, then at least one detective cookie is found for that person; Let $D$ be the event that for all unreliable workers, at least one defective cookie is found. 

\begin{align}
  Pr[D]     & = \sum_{i=1}^n Pr[]
\end{align}
