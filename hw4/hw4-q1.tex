\section*{1. (Geometric distribution) }

\subsection*{(a) (\textbf{In parallel})} 

Solution: From the description of the problem, we know that $X_1 \sim Geom(p1)$ and $X_2 \sim Geom(p2)$. We can write the two distributions as follows,

\begin{align*}
  Pr[X_1=i] & = (1-p_1)^{i-1}p_1 \text{ for $i \geq 1$ }\\
  Pr[X_2=i] & = (1-p_2)^{i-1}p_2 \text{ for $i \geq 1$ }
\end{align*}

For $X = \min{\{X_1, X_2\}}$, we can consider an imaginary new machine $M$, for each run, it is fails when either $M_1$ or $M_2$ fails. Thus, the new machine will have a failure probability $p = 1-(1-p_1)(1-p_2)$. Thus, $X \sim Geom(1-(1-p_1)(1-p_2))$.

$$
Pr[X=i] = \Big[(1-p_1)(1-p_2)\Big]^{i-1}\Big(1-(1-p_1)(1-p_2)\Big) \text{ for $i \geq 1$}.
$$

\subsection*{(b) (\textbf{007 stype})} 

Solution: Let $X_1$ and $X_2$ denote the number of times that James Bond will choose the air-conditioning duct and the sewer pipe respectively before choosing the unlocked door, and $X = X_1 + X_2$ is the number of wrong choices before choosing the unlocked door. Then $(X+1) \sim Geom(1/3)$. 

\begin{align*}
  Pr[X=i]     & = (1-1/3)^{i}(1/3) \\
              & = (2/3)^{i}(1/3) \\
\mathbb{E}(X) & = 1/(1/3)-1 = 2
\end{align*}

Since the air-conditioning and the sewer pipe have an equal probability of being chosen, then $\mathbb{E}(X_1) = \mathbb{E}(X_1) = \mathbb{E}(X)/2 = 1$. Then the expected time needed before choosing the door is $2\mathbb{E}(X_1) + 5\mathbb{E}(X_2) = 7$ hours.
